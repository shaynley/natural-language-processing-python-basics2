## text-analytics-in-python-guide
This is a resource demonstrating the concepts covered in the blog post: applications of text analytics, cleaning and pre-processing text data: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming and lemmatization, data exploration: word frequency, data visualization (bar chart and wordcloud), lexical diversity and part-of-speech (POS) distribution. 

## cookbook_excerpt.txt
This is a brief excerpt from Marion Harland's "Common Sense in the Household: A Manual of Practical Housewifery" (1871), sourced from Michigan State University's "Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Dataset." This is the text data we experiment with in the text-analytics-in-python-guide script.
